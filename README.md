# Document-Summarization
This is a project that aims at creating a shorter version of a given text document while retaining the most important information. The goal of document summarization is to reduce the time and effort required to read large volumes of text by presenting a concise and informative summary.<bt>

# Dataset
The dataset is a collection of 100 articles from the dataset All the news(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snapcrack/all-the-news) . The publications include the New York Times, Breitbart, CNN, Business Insider, the Atlantic, Fox News, Talking Points Memo, Buzzfeed News, National Review, New York Post, the Guardian, NPR, Reuters, Vox, and the Washington Post. 

The data primarily falls between the years of 2016 and July 2017, although there is a not-insignificant number of articles from 2015, and a possibly insignificant number from before then.<br>
